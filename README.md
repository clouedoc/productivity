# Productivity

> the effectiveness of productive effort, especially in industry, as measured in terms of the rate of output per unit of input.

This repository holds source code and documentation for my various productivity systems.

I know, I know, productivity stuff is for suckers. But I'm a sucker, so I'm going to do it anyway.

I also document general productivity techniques that I have found over time.

This way, everyone gets to write code faster and more efficiently!

## Applications

Here are the applications that I use to manage my productivity.

Each of them is not a silver bullet, but they are all useful in their own way.

(I've abandoned the idea of using a single application to manage everything. It's just not possible. Or I would need to build it, which would be very costly.)

### Exist

Exist is a quantified-self tool that allows me to correlate interventions with outcomes.

e.g. I want to know if taking Magnesium helps me sleep better.

### Complice

Complice is top-down TODO list. It helps you pick goals and create tasks based on them.

It's philosophy is hard to explain in a few words, so I'll drop a link: [here](https://https://complice.co/philosophy)

### Beeminder

Beeminder is a tool that helps you keep track of your goals and make sure you don't fall behind by charging you money if you do.

It features tons of integration; if you're in the red, just do the damn thing!

### Workflowy

Workflowy is a tool that helps you organize your thoughts and ideas. It's a great tool for brainstorming and planning.

I use it daily to keep track of my tasks. It also has a helpful integration with Complice that allows me to create tasks from Workflowy based on schedules. E.g. I can create a task to "write a blog post" and set it to recur every week.

## Techniques

### Time distortion crushing

I often find myself having a clear goal, but no time constraint.

In these cases, I get lost in the details and never finish anything.

Or I stray away from the task and do something else entirely. (e.g. I'll start reading a book instead heading to my desk to write a blog post, even if it's my next task and I've staked money on it with Beeminder.)

The root of this problem is that I think that I have much more time that I actually do.

To fix this, I use a technique that I called "time distortion crushing".

In practice, here's how it looks like:

1. I pick a task that I want to do.
2. I stake 5$ on it with Complice with a deadline of a few hours/minutes.
3. I do the task.

This forces me to do the task, and it also forces me to do it quickly. When I start to get distracted, I think about the money that I'm losing. I don't feel stressed, but I gently get redirected to the task at hand.

### Sleep enhancement

Sleep is the most important thing for your productivity.

If you don't sleep well, you won't be able to do anything.

#### Description of good sleep

1. You feel refreshed when you wake up
2. You do not feel awfully sleepy when you wake up
3. You do not feel sleepy during the day
4. 7 to 9 hours (sleep time, not bed time)
5. You wake up naturally
6. Has different sleep types in reasonable proportions

#### Optimization process

1. Buy a sleep tracker (I use a Fitbit)
2. Track your sleep for a few weeks
3. Note subjective sleep quality data in Exist (e.g. how you felt when you woke up, how you felt during the day, etc.)
4. Analyze the data
5. Make changes to your sleep routine
6. Repeat from step 2

#### Tests

Here are some optimizations that I'm actively using or planning on testing.

I input the data into Exist and analyze it to draw non-biased conclusions. (I don't test for Placebo effect because I don't care about it. If a pill works, it works. If it doesn't work anymore, then hell with it.)

| Optimization name | Description                                                       | Impact                     | Status                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Magnesium         | Magnesium is a mineral that helps you sleep better.               | non measured but I feel it | **Live**                |
| Zinc              | I didn't A/B test it, but I take it with Magnesium                | non measured but I feel it | **Live**                |
| Melatonin         | Melatonin is the sleep hormone. Small dosages works best (500mcg) | high                       | **Live**                |
| Alpha-GPC         | Supposedly increase REM sleep                                     | non measured               | received but not tested |
